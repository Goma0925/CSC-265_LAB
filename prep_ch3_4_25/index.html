      <h2>3. The Truth Continuum</h2><br><br>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this chapter, Cairo talks about the truthfulness of data visualization. He says that data visualization is essentially a model that simplifies the reality and communicate only the meaningful message, just as the road map sign on the side of highway. It reduces the details like mountains and rivers, but illustrates how each road is connected. The most important idea in the chapter are that 1) the reality is more complicated that we think. 2) Good visualization do not over-simplify information, but clarify it. This can be done by increasing the amount of information, bo reducing it. 3) Yet, visualizations should present the data and message concisely, reducing the probability of misinterpreting. He also presents the most common errors that people make in creating visualizations. The first one is the patternicity bug in which we jump on to patterns in the data regardless they are real or not. The second is the storytelling bug. We immediately come up with a coherent explanation for those patterns and tell false stories. The last error is the confirmation bug. We see further information but are stuck in the false explanation, concluding the contradictory data in a way supports the explanation.

          I find it easier to tell the truth better sometimes when I add reasonable explanation, which I am not sure about but have heard of, when I tell a trivia. Giving an example that seems to be backed up by scientific evidence helps convince people and makeS the logic flow smoothly. Cairo points out in the reading that this sort of lie might tell a story that could be useful and convincing in the short term, yet, destroys the point of data visualization and misleads people into false ideas in the long term.
