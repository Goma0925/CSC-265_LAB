          <h3>Q1. Why is visualization effective?</h3><br>
          A1. Because our brain can often be misled by numerical or non-visual data. Visualization makes it easier for us to understand the true nature of data. The reading brings up an example of different scales of exam, 0-100 and 0-137. In this example, the score 96 in the later scale is equivalent to 70 in the former scale although it seems it is way higher. To prevent the misunderstanding caused by our perception, we can visualize the data to make sure to expose the facts in more understandable ways.

          <h3>Q2. What are the more effective ways to encode data for perceptual tasks?</h3><br>
          A2. Cairo talks about many ways to encode data. Such as:<br><br>
          <div class="tab">
              a. Differentiate the format to represent the general trends, such as hues, area, shading in maps, and charts with precise numeric values to accurately convey the data.
              <br><br>
              b. “Always the data directly”. Present the data in a format that emphasizes the aspect of the data you want to show. For example, if you want to show the difference between two datasets, do not plot them separately, but plot the difference itself.
              <br><br>
              c. Use the most logical base-lines and scales. Generally 0 base-lines in graphs are recommended, but change the scale and base-lines depending on the set of data and its trend, considering how the data looks like to viewers.
              <br><br>
              d. Group the data accordingly to your intent of the visualization. For example, if you want to compare the differences among different age groups, plot the data for each age group.  <br>

          <h3>Q3. What are trade-offs that Cairo asks us to consider when building a visualization</h3><br>
          A3. We have to decide which aspect of the information to emphasize. By determining that, the other pieces of information might become difficult to grasp. Cairo gives an example of the differences among a radar chart, bar chart, and line chart. The radar chart is good for showing the general trend, bar chart for comparison, and line chart for representing relationships between entities on timeline.
