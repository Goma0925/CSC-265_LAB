      <h2>My cause: Innovation & Entrepreneurship</h2><br><br>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I picked this dataset because I have been always interested in innovation.  I think that it is a very cool to find needs and problems of people in the world and come up with a solution to make things work better. It requires cross-field disciplines and broad perspectives to find problems in a certain situations, as well as to come up with a solution that actually solves the problem, combining different skills, resources, technologies, and people. It sometimes also requires to be creative to approach the problem in new ways. This multi-disciplinary act of solving a problem always fascinates me because it requires us to utilize everything we have: resources, skillsets, money, ideas, communication, logical thinking, creativity, and all sorts of knowledge. In a way, people would measure your ability based not on the arbitrary criteria and how well you can follow instructions, but rather the result and ways how you approach the problems to solve them. Some of the entrepreneurs are good examples of innovation. They find problems in society and business and provide the solutions in innovative ways. This dataset shows that how entrepreneurial people are in each state, how much of those businesses are driven by necessity and needs rather than their own choice, how many jobs are created by each business, and how many of the businesses survived for a year.
