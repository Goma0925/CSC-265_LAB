      <h2>My cause: Innovation & Entrepreneurship</h2><br><br>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core of the innovation and entrepreneurship is to find the problems that people have and offer solutions for them. Those problems include everything from the inconvenient daily routines to inefficient manufacturing procedures in any industry fields. Since I would like to focus on the problems in the industries, I decided to find industry fields that are growing, or going to grow, which suggests there are many problems that would come up during the growth of the field.

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first dataset is the trade by enterprises in different fields. This dataset organizes the number of trades and and trade values in different industries. It also includes the years that would help to illustrates the change of the growth rate over time. I am hoping to use this data to derive which industries are growing and declining, and how rapidly so.

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second data set is the historical grow rate of the different sectors of industries. This dataset illustrates the number of firms, net income, revenues, and expected growth rate for each of different sectors. I would also like to use this data to compliment the first dataset to illustrates the growing fields where there would be more need for innovations and new businesses to solve problems.
