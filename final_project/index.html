    <div class="description">
    In this project, I am comparing the outputs of different industries and the number college graduates who go into those industries. I am hoping to see some correlations between the outputs and the labor force in different industries. Although I am still analyzing the data, here are some pieces of data that I am working on. One of the difficulties is that two of the datasets have slightly different format, which forces me to reformat the dataset.
